## Dataset Description

This dataset (dataset.json) is designed for aspect-based sentiment analysis. It includes textual data along with sentiment annotations for various aspects mentioned in the text.

### text
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: This field contains the main textual content. It represents the text data being analyzed or processed. Examples of the `text` field include:
  - "I've always believed in the importance of inclusive sporting events like NBMSG, but the execution this year was lacking. From the get-go, information was scarce, leaving many of us unsure of our roles and responsibilities."
  - "The food stalls, despite some limitations, did a fantastic job of offering a taste of home to many attendees. It was a nice touch that added to the overall welcoming atmosphere of the event."
  - "Volunteering gave me a sense of purpose. It's cool to be part of something that's all about celebrating diversity and bringing people together."

### aspects
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: This field contains a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a specific aspect of the `text` and its associated sentiment polarity. Each aspect is a feature or attribute mentioned in the text, and the value indicates the sentiment towards that aspect (e.g., Positive, Negative). Examples of the `aspects` field include:
  - `{"inclusivity": "Positive", "execution": "Negative", "information": "Negative"}`
  - `{"food stalls": "Positive", "atmosphere": "Positive"}`
  - `{"volunteering": "Positive", "sense of purpose": "Positive", "diversity": "Positive", "bringing people together": "Positive"}`

### is_train
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Description**: This field indicates whether the row belongs to the training set or the test set. The value is `True` if the row is part of the training set and `False` if it is part of the test set.
